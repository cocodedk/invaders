// Difficulty belongs to the level, not to progress: world 8 is hard even when played first.
// Exports: difficulty(world, index) -> d in [0, 1]; scaled(d) -> the rules at d; FIRE_UP.

// 0 at world 1 level 1, 1 at world 8 level 5, in 39 equal steps. Worlds 9-17 (the side worlds) set
// their own d per level, so the 39 steps of the main curve stay put. They span easy to the hardest in the game:
// world 10 is a step easier than world 4, between worlds 3 and 4; world 9 is about world 4-5 hard;
// world 11 sits about world 5's level, and its top (0.60) stays under the 0.6 where armorBonus turns
// on; world 12 runs world 6's own d (25/39 to 29/39), so armorBonus applies there, as in world 6;
// world 13 runs a notch above it, because its two rules (the wingmen and the broadside) help the player;
// world 14 runs another notch above that, to pay for the bursts of its shells (the fireworks);
// world 15 runs a notch above that again, because its two powers (the pearls and the trident) help the player;
// world 16 runs a notch above that again, because its mirror twin doubles the ship's gun;
// world 17 runs the top of the scale (1.0 on its boss, as world 8's last level), because the help its breath
// sends is paid for in that d: with it, its clear rates aim at world 7's.
// world 18, the first free-flight world (R67), runs the top of the scale too, as world 17 does, and the hardest world
// of all by its waves and its boss (the user asked for it): its clear rates are under world 7's.
