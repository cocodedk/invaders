// World 18's electrical effects (Anvil Sky), told as lightning. Two borrowed ones, the broadside's side shots and the guns opening
// and closing, which react-armada.js tells as cannon fire in world 13; the wrappers below tell them as arcs in world 18 and call
// the usual reaction anywhere else (the core emits both events in both worlds now, so the world has to be asked): a side shot is a
// blue-white muzzle flash, a thin ring, a fan of jagged arcs and a few sparks; the guns opening is a flash, a ring, a bigger fan
// and a rush of sparks at each flank with ARC GUNS written over the ship, and shutting a few fading sparks. And one of its own,
// `backfire` (core/collide.js, R67: an enemy homing bullet the ship has dragged round into an alien): an ELECTRIC BURST ON THE
// ALIEN, a white flash, two rings, five arcs thrown every way, a spray of sparks in cyan and yellow and a short BACKFIRE under it (the kill's score rises over it).
// An arc is ONE ring of kind 'arc' that draws itself from its age (ui/arc-fx-view.js, from its seed, so no particle is spent and the
// cap is never touched): { x, y, r (its length now, easing out to maxR), n bolts, ang and spread (the fan), seed, color }.
// Pure: randomness comes from `rng`, nothing is drawn, `world` is only read.
